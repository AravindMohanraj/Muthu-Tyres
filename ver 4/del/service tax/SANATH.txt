Since two of these loan accounts are nearing for closer of tenure period. We have approached your phone banking officials during july 2009 to obtain the details of outstanding amount on these loan accounts.

Your phone banking officials Mr. Sridhar and Miss. Uma have explained that the tenure period for loan account bearing No. 43314139 ends up on 18.10.2009 and for another loan account bearing No.43509738 ends up on 18.11.2009 as per your schedules.


They further stated that due to fluctuations in the rate of interest. we may have to pay one EMI amount in addition apart from the last EMI due.

They futher assured that even this additional EMI amount might be brought  down to a smaller amount in due course due to fluctuations in the rate of interest.

Since one of these loan acounts (loan A/c. No. 43314139) tenure has completed during Oct 2009, We have approached your bank to pay the last and final EMI.

Now They demand us to pay Rs. 191197.17 ( which more than five fold EMIS 36540X5=182700/-) to wipe off the entire outstanding due towards the loan A/c No 43314139 where as we owe only on final EMI due that is Rs. 36540/-

Further the same status is screened for loan A/c bearing No. 43509738, where in your bank demands for additional equated monthly installments where as we owe you only one EMI RS.27152/- AS ON 18.11.2009 AS per your schedule.

we afraid that the status of outstanding towards loan account No. 43937071 which endsup it's tenure during Aug 2010 may be alarmed with any irrelevent figure.


whenever the rate of interest is increased or decreased we used to assess the increase/decrease reflected on our outstanding loan amount figure due to interest. Fluctuations, and we closely monitor the revisions in the rate of interest. More over we use to obtain informations on interest revisions on a regular basis from the Reserve Bank of India.

we regret that we used to ceceive your note only ther is an upward  movement of the mortgage variable reference rate. We have been intimated very rarely on the decrease in interest rates.

please note that right from the first EMI, we have not defaulted on loan repayments of any of our loan accounts.

your abnormal and irrelevant out standing figures shows that these are the penalties imposed on client with a moral and finanacial discipline and who repays loands without any default.

your bank satatements for years together can vouch for our repayment track which goes smoothly with out any default.

we request your good selves to reconcile and state the correct amount due payable towards the above cited loan accounts and justify your outstanding figurers.

if your are not willing to reconcile the figures across the table and arrive at a decision amicably, we may take up this issue legally  with relevent records.


Thanking you,


yours truly,


(T.C.PRABHU/T.C.GIRI)
